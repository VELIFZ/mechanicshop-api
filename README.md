# Mechanic Shop API

A comprehensive RESTful Flask API for managing mechanic shop operations. Built with modern technologies including Flask 3.x, SQLAlchemy 2.0, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Docker with production-ready features.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Full CRUD Operations** for all entities:
  - **Employees** (mechanics, managers, admins) with role-based access
  - **Customers** with authentication and profile management

  - **Service Tickets** with comprehensive workflow management

### Advanced Features
- **Soft Delete** for service tickets and inventory items
- **Serialized Parts Tracking** with unique serial numbers and status management
- **Automatic Cost Calculation** with 8% tax rate on closed tickets
- **Complex Relationships** with many-to-many associations between:
  - Employees â†” Service Tickets (multiple mechanics per ticket)
  - Services â†” Service Tickets (multiple services per ticket)
  - Serialized Parts â†” Service Tickets (parts usage tracking)

### Security & Performance
- **JWT Authentication** with role-based access control (customer/employee)
- **Password Security** with bcrypt hashing and strength validation
- **Rate Limiting** via Redis (200/day, 50/hour per IP)

   ```

### Query Parameters

Most list endpoints support:
- `page` (default: 1)
- `limit` (default: 10) 
- `sort_by` (field name)
- `sort_order` (asc/desc)
- `status` (for tickets: open/in_progress/closed)
- `search` (text search)

Example: `/service-tickets?page=2&limit=5&status=open&sort_by=created_at&sort_order=desc`

##  Architecture

### Database Schema

The application uses a normalized relational database with the following key relationships:

- **Customer** â†’ **ServiceTicket** (1:Many)
- **Employee** â†” **ServiceTicket** (Many:Many) 
- **Service** â†” **ServiceTicket** (Many:Many)
- **Inventory** â†’ **SerializedPart** (1:Many)
- **SerializedPart** â†” **ServiceTicket** (Many:Many)

### Key Business Logic

- **Cost Calculation**: Automatic calculation of service ticket costs with 8% tax
- **Parts Management**: Serialized parts can only be used once per ticket
- **Status Workflow**: Service tickets follow open â†’ in_progress â†’ closed workflow
- **Soft Deletes**: Tickets and inventory use soft deletes for data integrity
- **Role-based Access**: Customers can only access their own data, employees have broader access

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/main.yaml`) with three stages:

1. **Build**: Environment setup and dependency installation
2. **Test**: Complete test suite execution
3. **Deploy**: Automatic deployment to Render on successful tests

### Required Secrets

Configure these in your GitHub repository settings:
- `SERVICE_ID`: Your Render service ID
- `RENDER_API_KEY`: Your Render API key

## API Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent structure:

### Success Response
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Operation completed successfully",
  "data": { /* response data */ },
  "meta": { /* pagination, etc. */ }
}
```

### Error Response  
```json
{
  "status": "error", 
  "message": "Error description",
  "details": { /* additional error details */ },
  "errors": { /* validation errors */ }
}
```
